## Introduction

This repo gives a simple setup to run code generated by AI into a single React file on your local system.

## Why?

When I asked Claude to generate code involving rendering Markdown, it started to incldue paclages into the code that is does not have installed on its own preview environment, so I could not check if the code worked. So I generated a version that could run the code locally on my own machine, and where I can install all packages that I need.

## Getting started

1. Add required packages (e.g. npm install react-markdown)
2. Add your generated code to `src\components\GeneratedComponent.jsx` (simple example of code generated by https://claude.ai is now there)
3. Execute `npm run dev`

## Improving on your code from here

Keep iterating on your code usinbg Claude, or use GitHub Copilot or other AI support in your editor.
